# Solid + TanStack Router (File-Based)

An [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com) example using SolidJS with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) using file-based routing.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Route Generation

Routes are auto-generated from the `src/routes/` directory. To manually regenerate:

```bash
bun run generate-routes
```

This project was created using `bun create tui`. [create-tui](https://git.new/create-tui) is the easiest way to get started with OpenTUI.
