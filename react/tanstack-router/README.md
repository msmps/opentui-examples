# React + TanStack Router

An [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com) example using React with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) (code-based routes).

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx create-tui@latest -t msmps/opentui-examples/react/tanstack-router
```

Or if you've already cloned this template:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

This project was created using `bun create tui`. [create-tui](https://git.new/create-tui) is the easiest way to get started with OpenTUI.
